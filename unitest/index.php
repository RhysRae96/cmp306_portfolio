<p>The Local Theatre Company has been operating since 1895, initially on the High Street but more recently moving to our new modern building. 
This state of the art building has two movie screens, each supporting 250 seats. 
We also have a 500 tiered seat theatre giving a great view of performances without losing the small theatre atmosphere. </p>
	
<p>It is our passion to support the local community and have an amateur dramatics society who put on regular shows as well as display spaces for local artists.</p>
	
<p>The new theatre building also enhances our support for a broad range of mobility access with the entire theatre being wheelchair accessible.</p>
